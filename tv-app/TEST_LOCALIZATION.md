# Testing Localization & Auto Country Detection

## How It Works

The app automatically detects the device language and maps it to a country:

1. **Language Detection:**
   - Samsung Tizen: `webapis.tv.info.getLanguage()` → "de", "fr", "es", etc.
   - LG webOS: `webOS.systemInfo.locale` → "de", "fr", "es", etc.
   - Browser: `navigator.language` → "de-DE", "fr-FR", "es-ES", etc.

2. **Country Mapping:**
   - `de` (German) → Germany (DE)
   - `fr` (French) → France (FR)
   - `es` (Spanish) → Spain (ES)
   - `en` (English) → United States (US)
   - And 44 more languages...

3. **Content Filtering:**
   - Popular Stations: Fetched from detected country
   - More From [Country]: Shows stations from detected country
   - Translations: Shows UI in detected language

## How to Test

### Method 1: Change Browser Language (Chrome)
1. Open Chrome Settings
2. Go to Languages
3. Add German (Deutsch)
4. Move German to top of list
5. Restart browser
6. Open app → Should show German UI + German stations!

### Method 2: Browser Developer Tools
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Console → Settings (gear icon)
3. Find "Override user agent locale"
4. Set to "de-DE" (German)
5. Reload page

### Method 3: Force Language in Code (Temporary Test)
```tsx
// In LocalizationContext.tsx, line 112, change:
let langToUse = savedLang || detectDeviceLanguage();
// To:
let langToUse = 'de'; // Force German for testing
```

## Expected Results

### German (de):
- UI: "Entdecken", "Genres", "Suche", "Favoriten"
- Country: Germany (DE)
- Popular Stations: German stations (e.g., Bayern 3, Radio Hamburg)
- More From: "More From Germany"

### French (fr):
- UI: "Découvrir", "Genres", "Recherche", "Favoris"
- Country: France (FR)
- Popular Stations: French stations (e.g., France Inter, RTL)
- More From: "More From France"

### Spanish (es):
- UI: "Descubrir", "Géneros", "Buscar", "Favoritos"
- Country: Spain (ES)
- Popular Stations: Spanish stations (e.g., Cadena SER, Los 40)
- More From: "More From Spain"

## Console Logs to Watch

When testing, look for these logs:
```
[Localization] Browser language detected: de-DE
[Localization] Using language: de
[Localization] Detected country: Germany DE

## Current Status

✅ Language detection: Working
✅ Country mapping: Working
✅ Translation loading: Working (602 keys)
✅ Popular stations filtering: Working
✅ Country stations filtering: Working
✅ Fallback system: Working (converts keys to readable text)

The system is fully functional! It's detecting English because your browser is set to English.
