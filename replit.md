# Mega Radio - TV Application

## Overview

Mega Radio is a full-stack web radio streaming application tailored for TV and large screen interfaces. It provides access to global radio stations from over 238 countries, organized by genres and countries. The application features an intuitive onboarding process, station discovery, favorites management, and continuous audio playback, all designed for an immersive television viewing experience. The project aims to deliver a high-quality radio streaming service on smart TVs.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions

The application is optimized for TV with a fixed 1920x1080px resolution, featuring large, easily focusable elements and an auto-hide header with smooth transitions. It utilizes Shadcn/ui components (based on Radix UI primitives) and Tailwind CSS, adhering to a "new-york" design system with custom CSS variables.

### Technical Implementations

**Frontend:**
-   **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript.
-   **Routing:** Wouter, specifically using hash-based routing for Samsung TV compatibility.
-   **State Management:** TanStack Query for server state, complemented by a custom API wrapper for error handling and infinite scroll.
-   **Design Patterns:** Component-based architecture, page-based routing, shared schema definitions, and Zod for validation with React Hook Form.

**Backend:**
-   **Framework:** Express.js for HTTP server and API routing, integrated with Vite.
-   **Data Layer:** Drizzle ORM for type-safe PostgreSQL operations (Neon serverless), with Zod for schema validation.
-   **API:** RESTful API endpoints under `/api`, communicating in JSON format.

**Platform Compatibility:**
-   **Unified TV Build:** A single `tv-app/` folder serves both Samsung Tizen and LG webOS, containing respective configuration files (`config.xml` for Samsung, `appinfo.json` for LG).
-   **Samsung Tizen TV:** Targets Chromium 76 (ES2015/ES6), requiring polyfills for newer JavaScript features, `&&` checks instead of optional chaining, IIFE bundle format, and a custom fetch polyfill.
-   **LG webOS:** Leverages HTML5 Audio/Video for playback and the `webOSTVjs-1.2.0` SDK.
-   **Platform Detection:** Automatic detection via user agent.
-   **Remote Control Navigation:** Implements an LGTV focus pattern using `useFocusManager`, `usePageKeyHandler`, and `getFocusClasses`. This system dynamically adapts to varying array lengths and multi-section layouts, ensuring focus lands on existing elements.
-   **Audio Playback:** A unified interface manages dual audio playback implementations: `webapis.avplay` for Tizen and HTML5 Audio/Video for webOS/browsers.
-   **TV-Specific Styling:** Custom CSS handles focus states, hidden cursors, scrollbar hiding, and platform-specific visibility.

**Application Flow:**
-   **Onboarding:** Guided tour for new users across key sections.
-   **Main Pages:** Discover, Genres, Search, Favorites, Settings, and a full-screen Radio Playing interface.
-   **Auto-Play:** Configurable startup modes including "Last Played", "Random", "Favorite", or "None".

**Localization & Internationalization:**
-   Supports 48 languages via API translations and automatic language detection based on the platform.

### System Design Choices

**Global Player:**
-   A `GlobalPlayerContext` ensures continuous audio playback and manages a persistent player bar across all application pages.

**Fixed Layout:**
-   The application uses a `fixed inset-0 w-[1920px] h-[1080px] overflow-hidden` CSS property for consistent layout rendering across all TV platforms and web browsers.

## External Dependencies

-   **Database:** Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless) for PostgreSQL.
-   **ORM:** Drizzle ORM (drizzle-orm).
-   **Build Tool:** Vite.
-   **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui.
-   **Forms & Validation:** React Hook Form (@hookform/resolvers), Zod.
-   **Async State:** TanStack Query.
-   **Routing:** Wouter.
-   **Typing:** TypeScript.
-   **Fonts:** Ubuntu font family.
-   **API Integration:** themegaradio.com API (for station data, genres, metadata, translations).

## Recent Changes (October 23, 2025)

### Country Selector Improvements:
**Unified design and fixed selection behavior** - All pages now use consistent country button styling
   - Created shared CountryTrigger component with purple background (#6b4f8a), flag, and arrow icon
   - Replaced duplicate implementations in DiscoverNoUser.tsx, Genres.tsx, RadioPlaying.tsx
   - Fixed CountrySelector to focus on currently selected country when opened (prevents accidental selection changes)
   - Modal initialization only runs on open, allowing proper arrow key navigation

### Genre Navigation Fix:
**Genre filtering now works correctly** - Clicking "Rock" shows rock stations instead of pop
   - GenreList.tsx now reads genre parameter from both hash-based params (#/genre-list?genre=rock) and window.location.search (/?genre=rock#/genre-list)
   - Fixes issue where hash-based routing prevented genre parameter from being read correctly

### Folder Structure Consolidation:
**Single `tv-app/` folder for all builds** - Eliminated separate client/ folder
   - Moved all source code from `client/src/` to `tv-app/src/`
   - Updated `vite.config.ts`: root now points to `tv-app/`, build outputs to `tv-app/assets/`
   - Updated `server/vite-runtime.ts`: references `tv-app/` instead of `client/` for both dev and production
   - Web preview and TV production builds now use same source folder
   - Simplified project structure: one folder for development, preview, and TV builds

## Previous Changes

### Bug Fixes & Enhancements:
1. **Onboarding Persistence** - Guides now show only on first app launch
   - Splash.tsx: Checks localStorage for 'onboardingCompleted' flag
   - Guide4.tsx: Sets completion flag when user clicks "Get Started"
   - Subsequent app launches skip directly to Discover page

2. **Country Search Filtering** - Enhanced debugging and verification
   - Added comprehensive logging to CountrySelector.tsx
   - Tracks real-time filtering with search query updates
   - Verifies Turkish character support (e.g., "t√ºrkiye")

3. **Country Button Design Consistency** - Unified across all pages
   - Updated DiscoverNoUser.tsx to match RadioPlaying.tsx design
   - Direct flagcdn.com URL construction for all country flags
   - Inline SVG arrow icon for consistency

4. **Genre Filtering Verification** - API confirmed working correctly
   - Direct API testing: genre=rock (4,409 stations), genre=jazz (jazz stations), genre=hip-hop (hip-hop stations)
   - Added extensive logging to GenreList.tsx and megaRadioApi.ts
   - Validates stations match requested genre, warns if API returns incorrect data
   - All navigation paths use genre.slug correctly (verified)
