## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The application targets a fixed 1920x1080px resolution, featuring large, focusable elements and an auto-hide header. It utilizes Shadcn/ui components (based on Radix UI primitives) and Tailwind CSS, adhering to a "new-york" design system.

### Technical Implementations
**Frontend:**
-   **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript.
-   **Routing:** Wouter, using hash-based routing for Samsung TV compatibility.
-   **State Management:** TanStack Query for server state.
-   **Design Patterns:** Component-based architecture, page-based routing, shared schema definitions, and Zod with React Hook Form for validation.

**Backend:**
-   **Framework:** Express.js for HTTP server and API routing.
-   **Data Layer:** Drizzle ORM for type-safe PostgreSQL operations (Neon serverless), with Zod for schema validation.
-   **API:** RESTful API endpoints under `/api`, communicating in JSON.

**Platform Compatibility:**
-   **Unified TV Build:** A single `tv-app/` folder supports both Samsung Tizen and LG webOS configurations.
-   **Target Platforms:** Samsung Tizen TV (Chromium 76 with polyfills) and LG webOS (HTML5 Audio/Video, `webOSTVjs-1.2.0` SDK).
-   **Platform Detection:** Automatic via user agent.
-   **Remote Control Navigation:** Custom focus management (`useFocusManager`, `usePageKeyHandler`, `getFocusClasses`) adapts to dynamic layouts.
-   **Audio Playback:** Unified interface managing `webapis.avplay` for Tizen and HTML5 Audio/Video for webOS/browsers.
-   **TV-Specific Styling:** Custom CSS for focus states, hidden cursors, scrollbar hiding, and platform-specific visibility.

**Application Flow:**
-   **Onboarding:** Guided tour for new users.
-   **Main Pages:** Discover, Genres, Search, Favorites, Settings, and a full-screen Radio Playing interface.
-   **Auto-Play:** Configurable startup modes (Last Played, Random, Favorite, None).

**Localization & Internationalization:**
-   Supports 48 languages via API translations and automatic language detection.
-   **Hybrid Geolocation System** (Priority-based):
    1.  **Tizen SystemInfo LOCALE API** (`tizen.systeminfo.getPropertyValue("LOCALE")`) for direct country code.
    2.  **Samsung webapis.productinfo** for fast synchronous country detection.
    3.  **LG webOS.systemInfo** for native webOS country detection.
    4.  **Browser Locale Parsing** extracts region from `navigator.language` (e.g., `de-AT` â†’ Austria).

### System Design Choices
**Global Player:**
-   A `GlobalPlayerContext` ensures continuous audio playback and manages a persistent player bar with song metadata display.

**Fixed Layout:**
-   Uses `fixed inset-0 w-[1920px] h-[1080px] overflow-hidden` CSS for consistent rendering.

**Navigation and Focus Management:**
-   Robust focus management across the application, with seamless transitions between components and pages.
-   Enhanced navigation with `PAGE_UP`/`PAGE_DOWN` keys for quick access to the Global Player.
-   Improved infinite scrolling for station lists using offset-based API pagination and dual triggers (scroll/focus).

## External Dependencies

-   **Database:** Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless) for PostgreSQL.
-   **ORM:** Drizzle ORM (drizzle-orm).
-   **Build Tool:** Vite.
-   **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui.
-   **Forms & Validation:** React Hook Form (@hookform/resolvers), Zod.
-   **Async State:** TanStack Query.
-   **Routing:** Wouter.
-   **Typing:** TypeScript.
-   **Fonts:** Ubuntu font family.
-   **API Integration:** themegaradio.com API (for station data, genres, metadata, translations).
