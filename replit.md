├── shared/           ← Shared types/schemas
├── package.json      ← Dependencies & scripts
├── vite.config.ts    ← Vite configuration
└── tv-app/           ← Samsung TV build output (deploy this folder)
    ├── index.html           ← Single entry point (LGTV pattern)

    ├── images/              ← All SVG icons/images
    ├── js/                  ← TV scripts (keys, audio, polyfills)

**Development:** Run `npm run dev` from root
**Samsung TV Build:** `cd tv-app && bash build-samsung-tv.sh`
**Deploy:** Upload entire `tv-app/` folder to Samsung TV

## Recent Changes

### October 19, 2025 - Complete Vanilla JS Conversion (ALTERNATIVE IMPLEMENTATION)
- **MAJOR CHANGE**: Created complete Vanilla JavaScript version as alternative to React implementation
- Stack conversion: React→jQuery, TypeScript→Vanilla JS, Vite→plain scripts, Tailwind→Bootstrap 4.4.1 + inline styles
- Created 22 new files: 8 core modules (state, router, API, player, localization), 11 page controllers, 1 sidebar component, 2 CSS files
- All pages follow LGTV pattern: init(), render(), bindEvents(), loadData(), cleanup() methods
- Page navigation: Hash-based routing with show/hide `.active` class pattern
- State management: Singleton AppState with pub/sub events + localStorage persistence
- **LGTV-Master Pattern**: NO build script, NO dist folder - everything flat at root level
- Deployment: Package entire root folder directly as .wgt (Samsung) or .ipk (LG webOS)
- See VANILLA_JS_CONVERSION_SUMMARY.md for complete documentation
- **NOTE**: Both React version (tv-app/) and Vanilla JS version (root index.html) are now available

### October 19, 2025 - Simplified to Single Index (LGTV Pattern)
- Consolidated project structure: Root is main development, tv-app/ is Samsung TV build output only
- Implemented single index.html pattern (like LGTV reference) - ONE file, manually editable
- Build script now updates bundle references IN-PLACE instead of regenerating HTML
- Fixed FocusRouter to use window.location.hash directly for Samsung TV hash-based routing
- Added base tag (`<base href="/">`) to fix image loading (no more file:/// errors)
- All assets (images, scripts) in correct locations for Samsung TV deployment
- Cache-busting with timestamps on all TV scripts

### October 19, 2025 - LGTV Focus Pattern Migration
- Migrated ALL 9 pages to LGTV focus pattern with `useFocusManager` + `usePageKeyHandler` + `getFocusClasses`
- Fixed critical bug: Dynamic array lengths prevent focus landing on non-existent elements
- Custom navigation logic for multi-section layouts with different grid column counts
- Focus system adapts dynamically to sparse datasets and empty arrays

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions

The application is optimized for TV with a fixed 1920x1080px resolution, featuring large, easily focusable elements. It includes an auto-hide header with smooth transitions. The UI is built using Shadcn/ui components (based on Radix UI primitives) and styled with Tailwind CSS, following a "new-york" design system with custom CSS variables.

### Technical Implementations

**Frontend:**
-   **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript.
-   **Routing:** Wouter (hash-based routing is **REQUIRED** for Samsung TV compatibility).
-   **State Management:** TanStack Query for server state, custom API wrapper for error handling, infinite scroll.
-   **Design Patterns:** Component-based architecture, page-based routing, shared schema definitions, Zod for validation with React Hook Form.

**Backend:**
-   **Framework:** Express.js for HTTP server and API routing, integrated with Vite.
-   **Data Layer:** Drizzle ORM for type-safe PostgreSQL operations (Neon serverless), with Zod for schema validation.
-   **API:** RESTful API endpoints under `/api`, JSON format.

**Platform Compatibility:**
-   **Samsung Tizen TV:** Targets Chromium 76 (ES2015/ES6) with polyfills for ES2019+ features, `&&` checks instead of optional chaining, IIFE bundle format, and a custom fetch polyfill using `XMLHttpRequest`.
-   **LG webOS:** Uses HTML5 Audio/Video for playback and `webOSTVjs-1.2.0` SDK.
-   **Platform Detection:** Automatic via user agent.
-   **Remote Control Navigation:** Migrated to LGTV focus pattern with `useFocusManager` + `usePageKeyHandler` + `getFocusClasses`. All main pages (DiscoverNoUser, DiscoverUser, Genres, GenreDetail, Search, RadioPlaying, Settings, Favorites, GenreList) use state-based focus tracking with dynamic array lengths to prevent focus landing on non-existent elements.
-   **Focus Index Mapping:** Sidebar (0-5) + Country Selector (6) + Page Content (7+). Each page implements custom navigation logic for multi-section layouts with different grid column counts.
-   **Audio Playback:** Dual implementation using `webapis.avplay` for Tizen and HTML5 Audio/Video for webOS/browsers, with a unified interface.
-   **TV-Specific Styling:** Custom CSS for focus states, hidden cursor, scrollbar hiding, and platform-specific visibility.

**Application Flow:**
-   **Onboarding:** Guided tour for Discover, Genres, Search, and Favorites.
-   **Main Pages:** Discover, Genres, Search, Favorites, Settings, Radio Playing (full-screen playback).
-   **Auto-Play:** Supports "Last Played", "Random", "Favorite", or "None" modes on startup.

**Localization & Internationalization:**
-   Automatic language detection (Samsung Tizen, LG webOS, browser).
-   Supports 48 languages via API translations using `LocalizationProvider` context.

### System Design Choices

**Global Player:**
-   `GlobalPlayerContext` manages continuous audio playback across all pages with a persistent player bar.

**Fixed Layout:**
-   Uses `fixed inset-0 w-[1920px] h-[1080px] overflow-hidden` for consistent layout rendering across TV platforms and web browsers.

## External Dependencies

-   **Database:** Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless) for PostgreSQL.
-   **ORM:** Drizzle ORM (drizzle-orm).
-   **Build Tool:** Vite.
-   **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS, Lucide React (icons - though mostly replaced by custom SVGs), Shadcn/ui.
-   **Forms & Validation:** React Hook Form (@hookform/resolvers), Zod.
-   **Async State:** TanStack Query.
-   **Routing:** Wouter.
-   **Typing:** TypeScript.
-   **Fonts:** Ubuntu font family (Google Fonts).
-   **API Integration:** themegaradio.com API (for station data, genres, metadata, translations).
