# Mega Radio - TV Application

## Overview

Mega Radio is a full-stack web radio streaming application designed for TV and large screen interfaces, offering access to global radio stations from over 238 countries, categorized by genres and countries. Its purpose is to provide an intuitive onboarding, station discovery, favorites management, and continuous audio playback, all optimized for an immersive television viewing experience. The project aims to deliver a high-quality radio streaming service on smart TVs with significant market potential.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions

The application is optimized for TV with a fixed 1920x1080px resolution, featuring large, easily focusable elements and an auto-hide header with smooth transitions. It utilizes Shadcn/ui components (based on Radix UI primitives) and Tailwind CSS, adhering to a "new-york" design system with custom CSS variables.

### Technical Implementations

**Frontend:**
-   **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript.
-   **Routing:** Wouter, using hash-based routing for Samsung TV compatibility.
-   **State Management:** TanStack Query for server state.
-   **Design Patterns:** Component-based architecture, page-based routing, shared schema definitions, and Zod for validation with React Hook Form.

**Backend:**
-   **Framework:** Express.js for HTTP server and API routing.
-   **Data Layer:** Drizzle ORM for type-safe PostgreSQL operations (Neon serverless), with Zod for schema validation.
-   **API:** RESTful API endpoints under `/api`, communicating in JSON format.

**Platform Compatibility:**
-   **Unified TV Build:** A single `tv-app/` folder contains configurations for both Samsung Tizen and LG webOS.
-   **Samsung Tizen TV:** Targets Chromium 76, requiring polyfills and specific JavaScript syntax workarounds.
-   **LG webOS:** Leverages HTML5 Audio/Video for playback and the `webOSTVjs-1.2.0` SDK.
-   **Platform Detection:** Automatic detection via user agent.
-   **Remote Control Navigation:** Implements an LGTV focus pattern using `useFocusManager`, `usePageKeyHandler`, and `getFocusClasses` for dynamic adaptation to layouts.
-   **Audio Playback:** A unified interface manages `webapis.avplay` for Tizen and HTML5 Audio/Video for webOS/browsers.
-   **TV-Specific Styling:** Custom CSS handles focus states, hidden cursors, scrollbar hiding, and platform-specific visibility.

**Application Flow:**
-   **Onboarding:** Guided tour for new users.
-   **Main Pages:** Discover, Genres, Search, Favorites, Settings, and a full-screen Radio Playing interface.
-   **Auto-Play:** Configurable startup modes (Last Played, Random, Favorite, None).

**Localization & Internationalization:**
-   Supports 48 languages via API translations and automatic language detection.

### System Design Choices

**Global Player:**
-   A `GlobalPlayerContext` ensures continuous audio playback and manages a persistent player bar.

**Fixed Layout:**
-   The application uses a `fixed inset-0 w-[1920px] h-[1080px] overflow-hidden` CSS property for consistent rendering across platforms.

## External Dependencies

-   **Database:** Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless) for PostgreSQL.
-   **ORM:** Drizzle ORM (drizzle-orm).
-   **Build Tool:** Vite.
-   **UI Components:** Radix UI primitives, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui.
-   **Forms & Validation:** React Hook Form (@hookform/resolvers), Zod.
-   **Async State:** TanStack Query.
-   **Routing:** Wouter.
-   **Typing:** TypeScript.
-   **Fonts:** Ubuntu font family.
-   **API Integration:** themegaradio.com API (for station data, genres, metadata, translations).
